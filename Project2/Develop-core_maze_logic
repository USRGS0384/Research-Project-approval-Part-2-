1- Implement Maze Generation Algorithm

Description: Develop and implement an algorithm to generate the maze structure dynamically.

Attachments: Pseudocode, technical specifications.

2- Implement Player Movement

Description: Write functions to handle player movement within the maze.

Attachments: Pseudocode, technical specifications.


Pseudocode for Maze Generation Algorithm

function generateMaze(width, height):
    initialize maze grid with walls
    choose random starting cell
    create empty stack
    push starting cell to stack

    while stack is not empty:
        currentCell = pop stack
        get unvisited neighbors of currentCell
        if unvisited neighbors exist:
            choose random neighbor
            remove wall between currentCell and neighbor
            mark neighbor as visited
            push neighbor to stack

    return maze grid



Technical Specifications for Player Movement

1- Player movement will be controlled via keyboard arrow keys.

2- Each movement attempt will check adjacent cells to ensure movement is within maze boundaries and not blocked by walls.

3- Player position and maze state will be updated dynamically based on user input.


In summary, the core logic for maze generation and player movement in your 2D maze game project. Adjust the specifics and technical details according to your project's requirements and chosen programming environment.
