Dev Complete Core Maze Logic Complete Description

Objective:

Finish developing the core logic that powers the maze game, ensuring all primary functionalities are implemented, optimized, and tested.

Achieving these criteria, the core maze logic will be considered complete and ready for further development or integration with additional game features.


1 Maze Generation:

Implement and finalize the algorithm for generating the maze structure.

Ensure the maze has a clear start and finish.

Verify that all paths are correctly generated with no isolated sections.

Optimize for performance, especially for larger mazes.

Pathfinding and Navigation:

2 Develop and refine the pathfinding logic.

Ensure the algorithm can find the shortest path from start to finish.

Implement efficient handling of obstacles and dead ends.

Optimize the pathfinding for real-time updates and player interactions.

3 Player Movement:

Finalize the movement mechanics within the maze.

Ensure smooth and responsive controls for player navigation.

Implement boundary checks to prevent movement through walls.

Integrate animations or transitions for movement feedback.

Collision Detection:

4Develop the collision detection logic.

Ensure accurate detection of player collisions with walls and obstacles.

Implement feedback mechanisms, such as visual or auditory cues, on collision.

5 Scoring and Progress Tracking:

Implement scoring logic based on player progress through the maze.

Develop a system to track and display the player's current position, score, and remaining time (if applicable).

Ensure the scoring system is fair and rewards efficient navigation.

6 UI/UX Integration:

Integrate core logic with the user interface.

Ensure all necessary information (e.g., score, time, player position) is displayed clearly and updated in real-time.

Implement intuitive controls and provide instructions/tutorials for new players.

7 Testing and Debugging:

Conduct thorough testing of the core maze logic.

Perform unit tests to ensure each component functions correctly.

Execute integration tests to verify that all components work together seamlessly.

Fix any bugs or issues discovered during testing.

8 Optimization and Performance:

Optimize the code for performance and efficiency.

Ensure the maze logic runs smoothly on all target platforms.

Minimize loading times and ensure the game remains responsive during play.

9 Documentation:

Document the core maze logic comprehensively.

Provide detailed explanations of the algorithms and methods used.

Include comments in the code for clarity and future maintenance.

10 Completion Criteria:

The maze generation, pathfinding, and navigation systems are fully implemented and functional.

Player movement and collision detection are smooth and accurate.

Scoring and progress tracking are correctly integrated and displayed.

The UI/UX elements are fully functional and provide a seamless user experience.

All components have passed rigorous testing and debugging.

The core logic is optimized for performance and well-documented for future development.
